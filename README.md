I made this schedule generator since management at my old job would copy-paste the schedule from the previous week and never change any of the shifts.

Purpose: The purpose is to distribute work days as evenly as possible based on how many days you are available to work.

To get started: Open the main program -> File -> Open -> Load the file "employees.txt" -> Add shifts "Morning" and "Night" and click Ok.
				Click Create -> For week I start at 500 and increase by 500 each day (i.e. 500, 1000, 1500) -> Where I worked the SE Ratio
				for Servers was 500 and for Cooks 750 -> Press OK -> Swtich to "Schedule" tab.
